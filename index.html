                Hiii! My name is <strong>Ellie Huo</strong> and welcome to this repo! 
                <br>
                I am a sophomore at the <i>University of California San Diego</i> studying computer science. I'm really loud, love food and kdramas and I'm very curious. As a kid, I've always been curious about everything and especially tech. How does wifi work? Why is it when I click a button it redirects me to another site? And also questions like the purpose of life (but thankfully God met me). Now, my questions are not all answered just because of one class but it started turning some gears in my head. The fact that everything is related to technology somehow makes my brain factory start producing a lot more questions and also many more perspectives. When the street lights outside my window turn on at night, I wonder how it was programmed to turn on at a certain time before dark and then turn off. When I play video games and I kill an enemy, I wonder behind my screen, all the calculations of damage that are being made. So I chose CS as my college major and I definitely struggle A LOT. But as it brings me new challenges, I can seek for new answers.
